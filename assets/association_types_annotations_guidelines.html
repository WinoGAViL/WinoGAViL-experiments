<br>
<p>In the following you are expected to annotate the asscoiation category type.</p>
<p>
<p>A pair of a cue word, and an association image is presented each time. </p><br>

<p>Please choose the most correct tag that describes each pair, out of these three options:</p> <br>

<h3>Visually Salient Object </h3><br> <p>The cue is one of the main visually salient objects/entities in this specific image. <br><br>
Do you see the cue as an object/entity in the image? is it clearly visualized in the image, and it is the main object/entity? (If so -> <strong>visually salient object</strong>) </p><br>

Examples:<br><br>
<p><img class="center-fit" src="https://winogavil.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/visually_salient.png" alt=""></p>
<br>

</p><h3>Visually Salient Activity</h3><br> <p>The cue is an activity depicted in this specific image. <br><br>
Do you see the cue as an activity in this image? (If so -> <strong>visually salient activity</strong>) </p><br>

Examples:<br><br>
<p><img class="center-fit" src="https://winogavil.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/activity.png" alt=""></p>
<br>

<h3>Visually Non-Salient</h3><br><p> The cue is related to something visual that is present in this particular image and not necessarily in other images with the same concept. But it is not a visually salient object nor activity (Not Visually Salient Object and not Visual Activity).<br><br>
The cue is visual but not salient object nor an activity? (If so -> <strong>visually non-salient</strong>) </p><br>


Examples:<br><br>
<p><img class="center-fit" src="https://winogavil.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/visually_non_salient.png" alt=""></p>
<br>


<h3> Concept Related </h3><br><p> The cue is related to the image concept, not necessarily to this specific image. <br><br>
Could you understand the cue with the image concept only? Without seeing the image?   (If so -> <strong>non-visual</strong>)</p><br>
